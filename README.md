Since Nechi stopped playing FGO around November/2021, I've taken it upon myself to continue updating this amazing Servant checklist with any new Servant releases for both NA and JP, as well as any usability or UX features I deem appropriate to enhance, simplify and increase its ease of use.

In its current state and given its JSDoc documentation, it can be forked and used for any "character collector"/gacha game as desired, with a bit of tinkering and customization.

The original version of this checklist project can be found here: https://nechigawara.github.io/nechi-fgo-checklist/

Libraries used:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap 4
* Popper.js
* Bootbox.js
* Select2 + Select2 Bootstrap Theme
* html2canvas
* lz-string

External sevices used:
* imgur (image hosting)
* is.gd (URL shortening)
* waa.ai (URL shortening)
* owo.vc (URL shortening)
* FileSaver.js (file generation, saving and loading)

What to do:
* Continue updating with new Servant releases
* Improvements as required or seen fit
