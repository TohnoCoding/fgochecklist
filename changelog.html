    <dd>First full initial implementation of the wishlist state. Do note that Servants can only have one of three states:
        "not owned" (dark), "owned at NP#" (light, with a number on the lower right corner), and "wishlisted at NP#" (dark,
        with a number on the lower right corner). There's currently no way to mark already owned units at further wishlisted
        NP levels.</dd>
    <dd>Initial implementation of the changelog modal, in case anyone wants to snoop around to see how the project's been
        evolving. Only important updates are logged here; adding new Servants isn't exactly remarkable. Any future major
        updates will be logged here.</dd>
