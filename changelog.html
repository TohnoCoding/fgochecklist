    <dt>2025/09/18</dt>
    <dd>Added Nemo/Noah. Not sure why I got around to doing this on my birthday, but it
    is what it is.</dd>
    <dt>2025/08/17</dt>
    <dd>Despite feeling like absolute garbage for the past four days due to an infection,
    added the latest batch of summer characters (Saber Lip, Rider Kriem, welfare Huyan,
    MoonCancer Shiki, Lancer Miyu, Archer Tiamat and Alter-Ego Crane).</dd>
    <dt>2025/08/06</dt>
    <dd>Added U-Olga Marie. WTF. Who knew we'd get to this point.</dd>
    <dt>2025/07/19</dt>
    <dd>Adjusted Yara√§ndoo's localized name as per official localization.</dd>
    <dt>2025/07/03</dt>
    <dd>Decided to start adding character updates here to not leave the changelog so empty.
    Added Indra.</dd>
    <dt>2025/05/19</dt>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Removing all references to Mash from the project caused a data
        structure to break that was causing the page to silently crash and get stuck with the
        Loading animation. This has been fixed and the data structure reworked to permanently
        prevent this in the future.</dd>
    <dt>2025/05/01</dt>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">MASH... YEEEEEEEEEEET! Because the Eggplant Kouhai seems to be a
    source of constant issues, given the recent JP shenanigans, and given that she's an
    immutable Servant in all accounts, I decided it was best for my sanity to just not track
    her at all. YEET!</dd>
    <dt>2025/01/18</dt>
    <dd>Removed the 'new' marker for the mode checkbox. It's been two months already so it
    should be pretty common knowledge by now. Oh yeah, also, happy new year and all that.</dd>
    <dt>2024/12/24</dt>
    <dd>Merry Christmas' Eve!</dd>
    <dd>Added Louhi and Santa Abby.</dd>
    <dd>Type-MOON &amp; Lasengle apparently want to give me a heart attack... Between Ciel,
    Space Ereshkigal and today's addition of freakin' PHANTAS-MOON... WHERE IS MY PLAYABLE
    AKIHA LASA&Ntilde;A!??!?! WHERE?!?!?!?!?!? WHERE BEST IMOUTO?!?!?!?!??!??!!?!?!?!!?!?</dd>
    <dt>2024/12/01</dt>
    <dd>Fixed some styling issues with the footer caused by mobile displays.</dd>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Removed some leftover unused CSS.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/30</dt>
    <dd>Adjusted the footer appearance so links would be more readable in the holiday styling.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/24</dt>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Fixed two bugs with Mash (I swear she attracts them) related to
    Fast Mode, one that allowed her to be marked as owned past NP3 and another that allowed
    her to be wishlisted. (Stop being so edgy and causing edge cases, kouhai, dammit!)</dd>
    <dd>Also fixed the options table width breaking the page on mobile because the Fast Mode
    label is so damn long.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/21</dt>
    <dd>Removed the notice above the availability toggle button about Fast Mode.</dd>
    <dd>Adjusted Fast Mode description with short explanation.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/19</dt>
    <dd>Added a new functionality to wishlist all unselected Servants automatically at NP1.</dd>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Reworked some of the existing functionality to accomodate for selecting
    Servants as wishlisted both in Class Mode and in the expandable menu.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/18</dt>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Reworked the entirety of the marking functionality to accomodate for a
        true wishlisted state.</dd>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Fast Mode functionality rewritten completely from the ground up.</dd>
    <dd><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: boldl;">REAL</span> Wishlist state now fully
        functional and deployed! Enjoy being able to tag Servants owned or not as being wishlisted,
        and at what level!</dd>
    <dd>Please report any issues you find in the project repository by
        <a href="https://github.com/TohnoCoding/fgochecklist/issues/new/choose"
        target="_blank">opening an issue</a>; that's the fastest way to grab my attention so I can
        start working on a fix immediately.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/08</dt>
    <dd>Wasn't feeling the checkmark so changed the user-facing updates icon to a page icon instead.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/07</dt>
    <dd>Adjusted the changelog so user-visible ("regular") changes are marked with checkmarks, and
        strictly code stuff that isn't visible to end user is marked with a code icon.</dd>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Full reorganization of JS library.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/06</dt>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Optimized multiple CSS assignment checks.</dd>

    <dd class="codeUpdate">Fixed another bug with selecting Mash backwards in Fast Mode.</dd>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Mash seems to be quite the lure for bugs, as another one was fixed related
        to her URL parameter when marking her as SR.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/04</dt>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Fixed a data definition typo on four Servants that was causing NP level issues
        (Dobrynya Nikitich, Hephaestion, Taisui Xingjun, &amp; Daikokuten).</dd>
    <dd class="codeUpdate">Also did a drive-by fix of an issue with selecting Mash in Fast Mode.</dd>
    <dd>Fixed an issue with the summoning of the changelog modal which wouldn't dismiss
        the darkening layer.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/03</dt>
    <dd>Didn't like the changelog summon animation so I made it slide down from the top
        and hide upwards.</dd>
    <dt>2024/11/02</dt>
    <dd>First full initial implementation of the wishlist state. Do note that Servants
        can only have one of three states: "not owned" (dark), "owned at NP#" (light, with a number on the
        lower right corner), and "wishlisted at NP#" (dark, with a number on the lower right corner).
        There's currently no way to mark already owned units at further wishlisted NP levels.</dd>
    <dd>Initial implementation of the changelog modal, in case anyone wants to snoop
        around to see how the project's been evolving. Only important updates are logged here; adding
        new Servants isn't exactly remarkable. Any future major updates will be logged here.</dd>
    <dd class="codeUpdate"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Please, if you find anything
        wrong with the site,
